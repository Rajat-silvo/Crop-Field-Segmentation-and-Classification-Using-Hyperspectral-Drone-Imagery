# Crop-Field-Segmentation-and-Classification-Using-Hyperspectral-Drone-Imagery

● Engineered a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for crop classification using drone hyperspectral imagery and TensorFlow.

● Performed the segmentation and classification using 4 different ways -
   - using a CNN
   - using Maximum Distance Algorithm
   - using Unsupervised Learning
   - using CNNCRF technique

● Worked on WHU Hyperspectral Dataset for training of model

● Applied PCA and data augmentation techniques to optimize spectral analysis of agricultural land.

● Implemented patch-based image processing and class balancing techniques to handle large-scale aerial surveys, enabling efficient crop monitoring and reducing manual inspection time for precision agriculture applications.

Achieved the best accuracy of 99.76% using the CNN model.

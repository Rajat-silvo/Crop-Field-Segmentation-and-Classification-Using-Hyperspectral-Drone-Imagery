# Crop-Field-Segmentation-and-Classification-Using-Hyperspectral-Drone-Imagery

● Engineered a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for crop classification using drone hyperspectral imagery and TensorFlow.

● Applied PCA and data augmentation techniques to optimize spectral analysis of agricultural land.

● Implemented patch-based image processing and class balancing techniques to handle large-scale aerial surveys, enabling efficient crop monitoring and reducing manual inspection time for precision agriculture applications.
